# Diner-Soundscape
This is a soundscape with noises from a diner.
In this audio file, I created the intro to my Diner soundscape.  This includes all the noises you might hear as you walk into a diner.  If you listen to the file, youâ€™ll hear a door opening, followed by a bell ringing, footsteps, someone shuffling into the booth and choosing music from the personal juke box.  If you have ever been to Ritz diner then you know what I mean.
